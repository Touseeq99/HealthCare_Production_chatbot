Several non invasive methods for diagnosis have been used in hypertensivepatients with a suspicion of renal arteries stenosis, such as colorDoppler ultrasound. The incorporation of echo enhancers (EE) tothe echographic technique has had a signiﬁcant impact for the yieldof the study. Objective: To analyze the feasibility of total visualization of main renal artery with and without EE. To determine the sensitivityand diagnostic speciﬁcity of the conventional color Doppler pa rameters for the diagnosis of RVH: renal peak systolic velocity(RePSV), renal aortic ratio (RAR): RePSV/peak systolic velocityat the abdominal aorta (AoPSV), with and without EE. A new in dex of velocities was also proposed: the renal hiliar index (ReHi Index): RePSV/renal hilum peak systolic velocity (ReHiPSV), andwas compared with conventional parameters in terms of sen sitivity and speciﬁcity, using angiography as the gold standardmethod. Materials and Methods: 77 patients were included (45 males, 32 females, mean age 54 years) between July 1998 and April2003. Echo Doppler analysis was made with and without EE,comparing the feasibility of visualization of the renal arteries in all their passage: proximal, medium, and distal. Three differ ent echo machines were used: Ving Med CFM 800 (2,5 MHzand 3,5 MHz transducer), Toshiba SSH 140 A (2,5 MHz and3,75 MHz transducer) and Hewlett Packard Image Point HX(2,5 MHz and 4,0 MHz transducer). An EE composed of 999mg of galactose and 1 mgof palmitic acid by each gram ofgrains was used with 300 mg/mL concentration. The direct pa rameters measured in the main renal artery were the following:(1) RePSV: as the highest Doppler velocity measured in sys tole in the main renal artery. (2) RAR: as the rate between re nal peak systolic velocity, RePSV, divided by aortic peak sys tolic velocity, AoPSV, measured at the abdominal aorta. (3) ReHiIndex: the rate between RePSV and renal hilum peak systolic ve locity, ReHiPSV, measured at the hilum in its extrarenal section.Stenosis was considered signiﬁcant when RePSV >200 cm/s, RAR>3.5 and new renal hiliar Index >2.7. Renal angiography was performed in 16 patients with echographic diagnosis of re nal artery stenosis. Statistical analyses included speciﬁcity, sensi bility, and relative risk calculations on the three mentioned directparameters. The Mantel Haenszel chisquare test was applied toanalyze statistically signiﬁcant differences between the discreteparameters. Results: 77 patients were examined with conventional color echo Doppler technique with and without EE. All 151 of 151 therenal arteries segments, proximal, medium and distal, were ob served with EE, (100% feasibility) and 137 of 151 without EE (91%feasibility) (p <0.001). Renal angiography revealed severe steno sis in 16 arteries ( >60%), 3 with moderate obstruction (40–59%), 10 normal, 2 occluded, and one absent.The diagnostic accuracyof the direct parameters for the diagnosis of severe renal steno sis was as follows: (1) RePSV >200 cm/s; 94% sensibility, 77% speciﬁcity, RR 9.17 (p <0.001). (2) RAR >3.5: 69% sensibility, 100% speciﬁcity, RR 3.6 (p <0.001). (3) New ReHi Index >2.7: 94% sensibility, 92% speciﬁcity, RR 12.24 (p <0.001).

Mariano, O. Pablo, C. Vicente, D. Alberto, B. Daniel, P . Rodolfo. Instituto del Corazon, Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires, Argentina. Background: Although indicators of surgical and medical treat ment have been applied to patients with typical dissection (AD) ofthe descending thoracic aorta, the natural history of descendingaortic intramural hematoma (AIH) is not yet clearly known. Objective: The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that the absence of ﬂow communication through the intimal tear inAIH involving the descending aorta has a different clinical coursecompared with AD. Methods: We prospectively evaluated clinical and echocardio graphic data between AD (76 patients) and AIH (27 patients) ofthe descending thoracic aorta. Results: Patients had no differences In age, gender, or clinical presentation. The development of pleural effussion or periaortichematoma was more frequent in patients with AIH than it was inpatients with AD. AIH and AD had same predictors of complica tions at follow up: aortic diameter ( >5 cm) at diagnosis and per sistent back pain. Although medical treatment was selected in thesame proportion between groups, surgical treatment was more fre quently selected in AD (39% vs. 22%, p <0.01). AD patients who received surgical treatment had higher mortality than those withAIH (36% vs. 17%, p <0.01). There was no difference in mortality between patients who received medical treatment (15% in AD vs14% in AIH, p =0.7). In follow up imaging studies of 23 patients with AIH,6 patients (25%) showed complete resolution and 6 pa tients (25%) increased the descending aortic diameter. Typical ADdeveloped in 3 patients (13%). A three year survival rate did notshow signiﬁcant difference (82 ±6% in AIH vs 75 ±7% in AD, p=0.37). Conclusion: AIH of the descending thoracic aorta have rela tively frequent complications at follow up including dissection andaneurysm formation. Medical treatment with very close imagingfollow up and timed elective surgery in cases with complicationsallow better management for patients with AIH of the descendingthoracic aorta. 2 ULTRASOUND DOPPLER TECHNIQUE AND THE RENAL AR TERIES: DIAGNOSTIC IMPACT OF THE ECHO ENHANCER SHU 508A AND A NEW RENAL HILIAR VELOCITIES INDEX S.

Introduction: Renal vascular hypertension (RVH) accounts for 1–5% of the total population of patients with high blood pressure.In addition, the prevalence between patients with coronary and pe ripheral vascular disease usually is greater to 40%. Several non invasive methods for diagnosis have been used in hypertensivepatients with a suspicion of renal arteries stenosis, such as colorDoppler ultrasound. The incorporation of echo enhancers (EE) tothe echographic technique has had a signiﬁcant impact for the yieldof the study.

Claessens, C. Claessens, M. Claessens, M. Claessens, J. Claessens. Eeuwfeestkliniek Antwerp Belgium. Background: To increase the performance capacity of a triath lete (Tri), a variety of adaptations are necessary. The heart is thecentral and the most important limiting factor. The structural heartadaptations in Tri have important repercussion on cardiac function.The left ventricular diastole shows speciﬁc characteristics that de termine performance capacity. Methods: 40 male Tri were compared with 31 active male con trols and with 112 patients with ischemic heart disease. All subjectsunderwent tissue Doppler and strain imaging. Results: The late diastolic ﬁlling period in Tri has speciﬁc char acteristics. Tissue imaging demonstrated in Tri speciﬁc character istics of both the late passive diastolic ﬁlling period and the earlyactive diastolic relaxation period. The signiﬁcant differences be tween the three groups concerning the strain values at the basaland the mid septum in the longitudinal axis by aortic valve closureand by mitral valve opening were extremely striking. The valuesof the end diastolic strain by the end of the a wave: negative inTri, near zero in normal controls, and marked positive in coronarypatients were fascinating (ﬁg. 1). 204 ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY: A Jrnl. of CV Ultrasound & Allied Tech.

Several non invasive methods for diagnosis have been used in hypertensivepatients with a suspicion of renal arteries stenosis, such as colorDoppler ultrasound. The incorporation of echo enhancers (EE) tothe echographic technique has had a signiﬁcant impact for the yieldof the study. Objective: To analyze the feasibility of total visualization of main renal artery with and without EE. To determine the sensitivityand diagnostic speciﬁcity of the conventional color Doppler pa rameters for the diagnosis of RVH: renal peak systolic velocity(RePSV), renal aortic ratio (RAR): RePSV/peak systolic velocityat the abdominal aorta (AoPSV), with and without EE. A new in dex of velocities was also proposed: the renal hiliar index (ReHi Index): RePSV/renal hilum peak systolic velocity (ReHiPSV), andwas compared with conventional parameters in terms of sen sitivity and speciﬁcity, using angiography as the gold standardmethod. Materials and Methods: 77 patients were included (45 males, 32 females, mean age 54 years) between July 1998 and April2003. Echo Doppler analysis was made with and without EE,comparing the feasibility of visualization of the renal arteries in all their passage: proximal, medium, and distal. Three differ ent echo machines were used: Ving Med CFM 800 (2,5 MHzand 3,5 MHz transducer), Toshiba SSH 140 A (2,5 MHz and3,75 MHz transducer) and Hewlett Packard Image Point HX(2,5 MHz and 4,0 MHz transducer). An EE composed of 999mg of galactose and 1 mgof palmitic acid by each gram ofgrains was used with 300 mg/mL concentration. The direct pa rameters measured in the main renal artery were the following:(1) RePSV: as the highest Doppler velocity measured in sys tole in the main renal artery. (2) RAR: as the rate between re nal peak systolic velocity, RePSV, divided by aortic peak sys tolic velocity, AoPSV, measured at the abdominal aorta. (3) ReHiIndex: the rate between RePSV and renal hilum peak systolic ve locity, ReHiPSV, measured at the hilum in its extrarenal section.Stenosis was considered signiﬁcant when RePSV >200 cm/s, RAR>3.5 and new renal hiliar Index >2.7. Renal angiography was performed in 16 patients with echographic diagnosis of re nal artery stenosis. Statistical analyses included speciﬁcity, sensi bility, and relative risk calculations on the three mentioned directparameters. The Mantel Haenszel chisquare test was applied toanalyze statistically signiﬁcant differences between the discreteparameters. Results: 77 patients were examined with conventional color echo Doppler technique with and without EE. All 151 of 151 therenal arteries segments, proximal, medium and distal, were ob served with EE, (100% feasibility) and 137 of 151 without EE (91%feasibility) (p <0.001). Renal angiography revealed severe steno sis in 16 arteries ( >60%), 3 with moderate obstruction (40–59%), 10 normal, 2 occluded, and one absent.The diagnostic accuracyof the direct parameters for the diagnosis of severe renal steno sis was as follows: (1) RePSV >200 cm/s; 94% sensibility, 77% speciﬁcity, RR 9.17 (p <0.001). (2) RAR >3.5: 69% sensibility, 100% speciﬁcity, RR 3.6 (p <0.001). (3) New ReHi Index >2.7: 94% sensibility, 92% speciﬁcity, RR 12.24 (p <0.001). The values of urea and creatinine in blood before and after the intravenousadministration of EE were similar (p <0.72), showing EE as a well tolerated product.

Mariano, O. Pablo, C. Vicente, D. Alberto, B. Daniel, P . Rodolfo. Instituto del Corazon, Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires, Argentina. Background: Although indicators of surgical and medical treat ment have been applied to patients with typical dissection (AD) ofthe descending thoracic aorta, the natural history of descendingaortic intramural hematoma (AIH) is not yet clearly known. Objective: The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that the absence of ﬂow communication through the intimal tear inAIH involving the descending aorta has a different clinical coursecompared with AD. Methods: We prospectively evaluated clinical and echocardio graphic data between AD (76 patients) and AIH (27 patients) ofthe descending thoracic aorta. Results: Patients had no differences In age, gender, or clinical presentation. The development of pleural effussion or periaortichematoma was more frequent in patients with AIH than it was inpatients with AD. AIH and AD had same predictors of complica tions at follow up: aortic diameter ( >5 cm) at diagnosis and per sistent back pain. Although medical treatment was selected in thesame proportion between groups, surgical treatment was more fre quently selected in AD (39% vs. 22%, p <0.01). AD patients who received surgical treatment had higher mortality than those withAIH (36% vs. 17%, p <0.01). There was no difference in mortality between patients who received medical treatment (15% in AD vs14% in AIH, p =0.7). In follow up imaging studies of 23 patients with AIH,6 patients (25%) showed complete resolution and 6 pa tients (25%) increased the descending aortic diameter. Typical ADdeveloped in 3 patients (13%). A three year survival rate did notshow signiﬁcant difference (82 ±6% in AIH vs 75 ±7% in AD, p=0.37). Conclusion: AIH of the descending thoracic aorta have rela tively frequent complications at follow up including dissection andaneurysm formation. Medical treatment with very close imagingfollow up and timed elective surgery in cases with complicationsallow better management for patients with AIH of the descendingthoracic aorta. 2 ULTRASOUND DOPPLER TECHNIQUE AND THE RENAL AR TERIES: DIAGNOSTIC IMPACT OF THE ECHO ENHANCER SHU 508A AND A NEW RENAL HILIAR VELOCITIES INDEX S.

Introduction: Renal vascular hypertension (RVH) accounts for 1–5% of the total population of patients with high blood pressure.In addition, the prevalence between patients with coronary and pe ripheral vascular disease usually is greater to 40%. Several non invasive methods for diagnosis have been used in hypertensivepatients with a suspicion of renal arteries stenosis, such as colorDoppler ultrasound.

Claessens, C. Claessens, M. Claessens, M. Claessens, J. Claessens. Eeuwfeestkliniek Antwerp Belgium. Background: To increase the performance capacity of a triath lete (Tri), a variety of adaptations are necessary. The heart is thecentral and the most important limiting factor. The structural heartadaptations in Tri have important repercussion on cardiac function.The left ventricular diastole shows speciﬁc characteristics that de termine performance capacity. Methods: 40 male Tri were compared with 31 active male con trols and with 112 patients with ischemic heart disease. All subjectsunderwent tissue Doppler and strain imaging. Results: The late diastolic ﬁlling period in Tri has speciﬁc char acteristics. Tissue imaging demonstrated in Tri speciﬁc character istics of both the late passive diastolic ﬁlling period and the earlyactive diastolic relaxation period. The signiﬁcant differences be tween the three groups concerning the strain values at the basaland the mid septum in the longitudinal axis by aortic valve closureand by mitral valve opening were extremely striking. The valuesof the end diastolic strain by the end of the a wave: negative inTri, near zero in normal controls, and marked positive in coronarypatients were fascinating (ﬁg. 1). 204 ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY: A Jrnl. of CV Ultrasound & Allied Tech.
