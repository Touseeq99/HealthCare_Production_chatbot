Although the writingcommittee has tried to make signi ﬁcant progress in this current guideline to address many of the gaps in theclinical management of AF, important gaps in knowledgeremain and are listed below. 1.AF as a disease continuum: AF must be seen as a disease continuum, yet historically the emphasis hasbeen on rhythm management.
