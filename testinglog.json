I had a routine antenatal appointment at my local hospital at 28 weeks, I waited 2.5 hours to see the consultant and when I mentioned my symptoms, he said I was pregnant, and that he would up my thyroxine to help (I have an underactive thyroid which was diagnosed 10 years prior). I was rushed out of the office within 5 minutes not even having been examined despite the long wait. I felt that I was wasting his time. The symptoms continued to get worse over the next few days, to the point where I couldn’t catch my breath just walking a few paces and my ankles and wrists became swollen. I was breathless from the slightest activity and when I lay down, it felt like I was drowning. It was awful and I was so worried about my baby. I knew something was seriously wrong as I had been pregnant 10 years earlier with my son, Ryan, and I had never felt like this. At 30 weeks pregnant, I attended one of my routine midwife appointments and she was extremely concerned about the fact that I could not even speak without being breathless. I think I had become used to this as I didn’t realise I was so bad. The midwife took me to one of the GPs who listened to my lungs and heart and said he was concerned. He said I needed to rest and if I was no better in 4 or 5 days, he wanted to see me again. I told them that I had advised the antenatal clinic but was told not to worry. My symptoms continued and, so, just 5 days later, I saw my midwife as well as the same GP again. He listened to my lungs Emma Taylor was diagnosed with left heart failure when she was pregnant with her second son at only 31 years of age.

I was given injections to help mature my baby’s lungs but the hope was that I could manage at least 2 more weeks before delivering. I had no choice but to stay in hospital until my baby was born. The medications I was put on for 2 days prior to Conor being born were beta blockers and diuretics along with an ACE inhibitor. I did not take anything that crossed the placenta or supply of blood to Conor; they only gave me what would not harm him as I refused anything else until after he had been delivered. By this time my symptoms worsened and I wasn’t able to do anything on my own. I had developed a life threatening arrhythmia which meant my heart was beating 200 times a minute. It was at this point that the doctors said we could not wait any longer and I was moved to anoth er hospital with a special heart unit to deliver my son the following morning. During the evening I was visited by an obstetrician and cardiologist who said I should decide whether to be sterilised at the same time as the C Section, as I should not have any further children. We were given 30 minutes to decide. This was a ter rible shock and I felt extremely guilty as my partner was only 23; however, he agreed that he did not want to see me go through anything like this again and I should pro ceed as we thought both myself and our baby were going to die. The next morning at approximately 10:30 am, my son was delivered. He weighed 4lb 8ozs and was taken away from me to special care as he was having diffi culty breathing. I was taken to the HDU and I\n\n--- Document 2 (Living with heart failure after peripartum cardiomyopathy..pdf) ---\n254\b British\b Journal\b of\bCardiac\b Nursing\b\b\b\b May\b 2015\b\b\b\b Vol\b10\bNo\b5 Patient Perspective © 2014 MA Healthcare LtdLiving with heart failure after peripartum cardiomyopathy again and said ‘I need to send you back to the hospital to A&E’ and he gave me a letter and asked me if I would like an ambulance. I said no and that my (then) fiancé would take me. Once we got to A&E, I handed in the letter, they took details of my symptoms and asked me to take a seat. Within 10 min utes, I was taken through to a cubicle. I was placed on a heart monitor and they took my blood gases and did a number of tests. They asked me to remain on the bed but I could not lay flat. I was then trans ferred to the Acute Admissions Unit as they did not know what was wrong with me. The staff wanted to take some chest X rays as they were concerned there could be blood clots in my lungs. After one night, I was transferred to a cardiac unit. Again, I had not been told what was wrong and I was taken for more tests, the last of which was an echo cardiogram. This was to be the test that would tell them what was wrong. I was taken back to the ward and after a couple of hours, my bed was surrounded by a team of approximately six nurses and doctors. A cardiac consultant told me I had left heart failure and my lungs were drown ing in fluid which had gathered around my heart. This causes breathlessness and swell ing of the legs because the body retains water when the heart fails, causing fluid to leak out into the lungs and legs and pool there. I did not understand what he meant and could not believe it—I was only 31 years old. I was in complete shock and could not take it in. I was told my heart was enlarged and that I was dangerously ill. I was assigned a nurse who then explained what was happening in terms I could under stand. I was not allowed out of bed alone, not even to go to the bathroom. I had to be taken in a wheelchair. This was extremely difficult for me as I had always been very independent. I also had to be taken for a bath as I was not allowed to be left alone. The doctors couldn’t believe it because peripartum cardiomyopathy was very rare at that time. An anaesthetist came from London to speak to me as he was writing a book on the condition. Owing to being pregnant, I didn’t want to take any drugs that would cross the placenta and poten tially harm my baby. But the doctors said I needed to be put on medication urgently so Istarted feeling breathless 4 or 5 months into my second pregnancy. Initially, the doctors put it down to my growing baby combined with me being an ‘older’ mother—I was 31 years old. Despite a number of scans and visits to the hospital, I was told not to worry and that the problem would resolve itself as soon as the pressure was taken off my body when my baby was born. I had a routine antenatal appointment at my local hospital at 28 weeks, I waited 2.5 hours to see the consultant and when I mentioned my symptoms, he said I was pregnant, and that he would up my thyroxine to help (I have an underactive thyroid which was diagnosed 10 years prior).

The patient had a history of stomach ulcers and drank alcohol socially. He ate an unbalanced diet for many years. His BMI was 20.2 kg/m2and blood pressure was 97/45 mmHg. Para doxical pulsation was not observed. The patient ’s heart rate was 92 bpm and oxygen saturation was 98 % at room air. A physical examination revealed jugular ven ous distention, although heart and breath sounds were unremarkable. Bilateral pitting edema was observed throughout the legs and muscle tenderness in the lower extremities was noted. A chest X ray showed cardiomeg aly, pulmonary vascular congestion, and pleural effusion. An electrocardiogram revealed ST segment depression in leads V4 5 (Fig. 1a).

A mod erate amount of pericardial effusion was noted and mitral Doppler measurements showed the peak E wave velocity of 112 cm/s, the E/A ratio of 1.6, and E wave deceleration time of 151 ms; consistent with a pseu donormal pattern. No significant respiratory E wave variation (17 %) was observed (Fig. 2a). Tricuspid re gurgitation was observed with a maximal velocity (TR V max) of up to 3.4 m/s. The inferior vena cava was markedly dilated to 23 mm and respiratory variation was diminished. Arterial blood gas analysis showed severe metabolic acidosis with an elevated lactate level of 56 mg/dL, while pH was preserved by a com pensatory hyperventilation r esponse. B type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels were elevated to 322.8 pg/mL. No evidence of any viral infection or mycobacterium tuberculosis, both possible cause pericarditis, was found. Thyroid function was also normal. In addition, no malignancies were observed and all immunological profiles were negative. Intravenous furosemide was administered to the patient, however, his condition failed to improve. Hemodynamic evaluation using a Swan Ganz catheter revealed high out put heart failure with low peripheral vascular resistance and constrictive physiology, cardiac index of 5.35 l/min/ m2, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 18 mmHg, and systematic vascular resistance of 400 dyne sec cm 5.Right ventricular (RV) and LV end diastolic pressures were approximately equal (20 and 19 mmHg, respectively) and exhibited a dip and plateau pattern (Fig. 3; Table 1).

How should heart failure be conceptualised as a clinical syndrome rather than a \nsingle disease entity?  \nSample expert answer:  \nHeart failure (HF) is best understood as a final common clinical syndrome  resulting \nfrom diverse structural, functional, and molecular abnormalities that impair the heart’s \nability to deliver adequate cardiac output at normal filling pressures. It is not a diagnosis \nin isolation but a dynamic state reflecting maladaptive neuroh ormonal activation, \nventricular remodelling, systemic inflammation, and end -organ interaction. \nImportantly, heart failure exists along a continuum, with progressive myocardial, \nvascular, renal, and metabolic involvement, meaning that its manifestations and  \nprognosis are determined as much by systemic comorbidities as by intrinsic cardiac \ndysfunction.\n\n--- Document 2 (expert1ccf.pdf) ---\n2. What are the fundamental pathophysiological mechanisms underlying heart \nfailure progression?  \nSample expert answer:  \nHeart failure progression is driven by a complex interplay of haemodynamic stress and \nneurohormonal activation . Reduced cardiac output or elevated filling pressures \nactivate compensatory mechanisms including the sympathetic nervous system, renin –\nangiotensin –aldosterone system, and arginine vasopressin. While initially adaptive, \nchronic activation leads to myocardi al fibrosis, adverse ventricular remodelling, sodium \nand water retention, endothelial dysfunction, and worsening ventricular performance. \nAt a cellular level, abnormalities in calcium handling, mitochondrial energetics, and \ncardiomyocyte apoptosis further perpetuate contractile dysfunction, creating a self -\nreinforcing cycle of deterioration.\n\n--- Document 3 (expert1ccf.pdf) ---\n5. What is the role of congestion in heart failure pathophysiology and outcomes?  \nSample expert answer:  \nCongestion is the dominant driver of symptoms, hospitalisation, and prognosis in heart \nfailure and often precedes overt declines in cardiac output. Elevated intracardiac filling \npressures lead to pulmonary and systemic venous congestion, impairing organ fu nction \neven in the presence of preserved systolic performance. Importantly, congestion can be \npresent without significant weight gain or peripheral oedema, highlighting the \nlimitations of traditional clinical assessment. Persistent subclinical congestion \npromotes inflammation, renal dysfunction, and myocardial stress, making effective \ndecongestion a central therapeutic objective in both acute and chronic heart failure \nmanagement.\n=== END EXPERT OPINION ===\n\n=== PATIENT OPINION ===\n--- Document 1 (patient1af.pdf) ---\n1. How did you first realise something was wrong with your heart?  \nSample patient answer:  \nI didn’t initially think it was my heart. I noticed sudden episodes where my heart felt like \nit was racing or fluttering irregularly, often out of the blue. Sometimes it felt like it was \nskipping beats, other times like it was pounding very fast. What made  me worry was that \nit didn’t feel like normal stress or exertion —it could happen when I was resting or even \nlying in bed. Over time, the unpredictability became unsettling and prompted me to \nseek medical advice.\n\n--- Document 2 (patient1af.pdf) ---\n5. What concerns did you have when you were first diagnosed?  \nSample patient answer:  \nMy biggest concern was the risk of stroke. Hearing that AF increases stroke risk was \nfrightening, and it made the diagnosis feel very serious. I was also worried about \nwhether this was something that would shorten my life or progressively get worse. \nAnother concern was whether I would be able to live normally or if I would always feel \nlimited by the condition.\n\n--- Document 3 (patient1af.pdf) ---\n7. What has been your experience with rhythm control treatments, such as \ncardioversion or ablation?  \nSample patient answer:  \nCardioversion was a relief at first because returning to a normal rhythm felt like getting \nmy life back. However, when AF returned, it was disappointing and emotionally difficult. \nThe idea of catheter ablation was intimidating, but it also gave me hope. I saw it as a \nchance not just to control symptoms, but to reduce how much AF dominated my life. \nEven knowing it might not be a permanent cure, having an active treatment option was \nempowering.\n=== END PATIENT OPINION ==="
